WHAT IF YOU DO HAVE A LIBRARY WHERE YOU CAN'T INSTALL @TYPES?

- <script> tags in index.html define variable

    var GLOBAL = 'This is set'

- use DECLARE keyword to declare certain variables

    declare var GLOBAL: string;

- this tells TS that this variable exists
- this command is important because it allows you to declare TS features or variables where you know that they exist or 
- let TS know about packages, global variables in general, which TS can't know, but as a developer know that they will be there
