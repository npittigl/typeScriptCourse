- in terminal in project file name type:

npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server typescript ts-loader

- in 'package-json' file will see added dependencies:

"devDependencies": {
    "lite-server": "^2.6.1",
    "ts-loader": "^9.5.1",
    "typescript": "^5.4.5",
    "webpack": "^5.91.0",
    "webpack-cli": "^5.1.4",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^5.0.4"
  }

  1. webpack: heart of this entire setup 
  
  - it's a tool that allows us to plug in certain functionalities to transfrom our TS code into JS & bundle all JS output together

  2. webpack-cli: 

  - runs webpack commands in our project

  3. webpack-dev-server: built in development server

  - start webpack under the hood, which watches our files for changes, automatically triggers webpack to recompile when something changes and which also serves our page

  4. typescript: we already installed typescript globally on our machine, which is why we are able to run tsc -w

  - it is good practice to auto install a copy of typescript PER project, so that you have a specific typescript version

  - the advantage of this is that if you ever change your global typescript version, you don't break your project version

  5. ts-loader: 

  - is a package that tells webpack how to convert typescript code to JavaScript

    - that way webpack is able to do both: compile our code with the help of ts-loader, which of course uses the TS compiler under the hood, and then webpack is also able to bundle our emitted JS files into a bundled js file into one bundled code file
