- if open up Network tab in browser dev tools and reload the project file, we will see the disadvantage of having a ES6 modules set up

- you can see a bunch of HTTP requests coming from our .js files

- if you look at the 'waterfall' on the right hand side, you will see that every HTTP request has like a base overhead, a base duration it always takes

    - the actual downloading of the file may be quite fast, but setting up the request, doing the work on the server, that all takes some time

- having that many requests can really introduce a lot of latency and slow down your project just because of the sheer amount of HTTP requests made

- webpacks help reduce the amount of HTTP requests

- webpack is a tool that will help bundle our files together

- can go to webpack.js.org to read their extensive & comprehensive documentation

- we will just use some selected features that help us with takes

WHAT IS WEBPACK?
- it is a bundling tool
- it reduces the amount of HTTP requests by bundling code together
- so when we split up code across multiple files using ES Modules, webpack bundles them together

- it can also optimize our code
- allows us to add more build steps, more build tools (ex. CSS files), etc.

NORMAL SETUP:
- multiple .ts files & imports (HTTP requests)
- unoptimized code (not as small as possible)
- "external" development server needed (lite-server)

WEBPACK SETUP:
- bundles our code, less imports required
- helps optimize code (minimizes code so less code to download)
- easier to add more build steps
