Using Google Maps unfortunately requires a credit card, even though you got a generous free tier which you very likely wouldn't exceed.

If you got no credit card, you can look into OpenLayers as an alternative (here's how to render a map with it: https://openlayers.org/en/latest/doc/quickstart.html).

In our concrete example, this would render a map:

Include this in your HTML file:

     <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/openlayers/openlayers.github.io@master/en/v6.1.1/css/ol.css" type="text/css">
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/openlayers/openlayers.github.io@master/en/v6.1.1/build/ol.js"></script>

In app.ts, use this code:

    declare var ol: any;
     
    function searchAddressHandler(event: Event) {
      event.preventDefault();
     
      const coordinates = {lat: 40.41, lng: -73.99}; // Can't fetch coordinates from Google API, use dummy ones
     
      document.getElementById('map')!.innerHTML = ''; // clear <p> from <div id="map">
      new ol.Map({
        target: 'map',
        layers: [
          new ol.layer.Tile({
            source: new ol.source.OSM()
          })
        ],
        view: new ol.View({
          center: ol.proj.fromLonLat([coordinates.lng, coordinates.lat]),
          zoom: 16
        })
      });
    }

You can explore the OpenLayers docs to learn how to render a broad variety of different things.
